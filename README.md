# oakd_models
URDF models, materials and Gazebo demo worlds for the Luxonis OAKD v1 Stereo AI Camera. 
You will need to run stereo_image_proc along with this model to get disparity images and pointcloud. 

I've validated this model on the Gazebo simulation of my rover, [Tenacity](https://github.com/jetdillo/tenacity_rover), but haven't tested it extensively on other simulations/worlds. \
This replicates the OAKD B&W cameras as described on the [Luxonis Hardware page about the OAK-D](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/BW1098OAK.html#depth-perception). The center RGB camera is not emulated yet.
